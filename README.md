# 📂 Internship Python Projects – @Arch Technologies

During my internship at @Arch Technologies, I have worked on practical Python & Machine Learning projects to strengthen my real-world coding skills.

## 1️⃣ Email Spam Classifier 📨

Data preprocessing and normalization

Detects whether an email is Spam or Not Spam

Uses TF-IDF, ML algorithms (Naive Bayes, XGBoost, Random Forest, etc.)

Accuracy: up to 97%

**Streamlit Web App**: test emails in real-time

## 2️⃣ MNIST Digit Classifier ✨

Recognizes handwritten digits (0–9) from image data

Trained ML models for high accuracy classification

Strengthened skills in image preprocessing & model evaluation

**Key Takeaways:**

Built end-to-end ML pipelines

Hands-on experience with Streamlit apps

Improved problem-solving & coding discipline 💡🐍

This internship will help to learn new and advance ML algorithms and to work on real projects.
